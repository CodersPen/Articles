# Web Accessibility 101: Intersectional Inclusion in the Digital World

According to the [World Report on Disability](https://www.who.int/disabilities/world_report/2011/report/en/) published by the World Health Organization, there is an estimate of 1 billion people in the world living with some form of disability, this constitutes around 15% of the world population that might depend on some form of assistive technology for operating a computer.

Web accessibility is about making web documents and applications usable and understandable by the largest group of people possible regardless of their cognitive, physical and sensorial abilities, without discriminating by the way that they operate their computer or by their social and economical background.

It involves multidisciplinary work between web developers, user experience designers, digital product managers, content creators and writers, testers and QA engineers and some other disciplines, in this article I will focus on the developer and QA approach towards creating more accessible experiences in the world wide web, by providing a glimpse into the authoring guidelines recommended by the World Wide Web consortium for the development of accessible websites and by reviewing some open source tools that will assist us in creating and testing accessible web experiences.
